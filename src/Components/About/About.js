            Hey🙋‍♂, My name is Mohak Gadge, I am a person with deep knowledge
            of data structures, algorithms, operating systems, database
            management systems and well known web development
            frameworks/libraries like React.js. I have strong a understanding of
            Object oriented programming and design with experience in C++. I
            have an experience of 4 months as a full stack intern where test
            driven development was followed and it helped me to learn about the
            software development tools and life cycle.
