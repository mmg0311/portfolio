                  Heyüôã‚Äç‚ôÇ, My name is Mohak Gadge, I am a final year student at Pune Institute of Computer Technology,
                  Pune (PICT, Pune). Who is fascinated towards full stack development,
                  explored a few technologies for the full stack development and still learning
                  a lot whenever I explore a new technology I try implementing it as a starter
                  project and push it onto the git so that they can be referenced when required.
                  I like exploring new things and implementing them. I try to keep myself
                  updated by reading articles about the tech evolution. I have made a few
                  full stack web projects and Android apps also which can be found on my
                  github account and I am currently also improving my skills and knowledge
                  by doing competitive programing.
